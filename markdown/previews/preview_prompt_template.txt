### Updated reusable prompt for weekly previews (with extra trash talk)

Copy/paste and fill the brackets weekly.

Write a markdown “Week [WEEK_NUMBER] [YEAR] Preview” for the DKE Fantasy Football league.

Data source rules:
- Use historical results from scripts/everygame.js for head-to-head totals and averages.
- Use this seasons results for predictions from scripts/stats2025.js
- If no history for a pair: say “First-ever meeting” and omit averages.

Per-matchup output:
- Section header: “### [TEAM A] vs [TEAM B]”
- Head-to-Head: “[Leader] leads X–Y (N games)” (or “Tied X–X (N games)”)
- Avg Points: “[TEAM A] [A_PPG] — [TEAM B] [B_PPG]” (round to 2 decimals; skip if no history)
- Vibe Check: 2–3 sentences using series trends (blowouts, close games, scoring styles, recent tone if visible).
- Spice It Up: 1 punchy trash-talk line (clever/snarky but not personal; fun rivalry energy).
- Bold Call: One specific prediction and “Edge: [TEAM]”.

Global output structure (GitHub-flavored markdown only):
- Title: “# [YEAR] Week [WEEK_NUMBER] Preview”
- “Generated on:” line
- “## Matchups” followed by one section per matchup (in given order)
- “## Notes and Nuggets” with 2–3 bullets (explain averages are head-to-head per-game; source is everygame.js; trash talk is in good fun)
- “## Bookmark This Week’s Storylines” with 4–6 bullets on interesting angles
- No HTML, no extra commentary.

Inputs this week:
- Week: [WEEK_NUMBER], Year: [YEAR]
- Matchups (exact order):
  1) [TEAM_A1] vs [TEAM_B1]
  2) [TEAM_A2] vs [TEAM_B2]
  3) [TEAM_A3] vs [TEAM_B3]
  4) [TEAM_A4] vs [TEAM_B4]
  5) [TEAM_A5] vs [TEAM_B5]
  6) [TEAM_A6] vs [TEAM_B6]

Style constraints:
- Round averages to 2 decimals.
- Keep “Vibe Check” informative; keep “Spice It Up” witty/short (1 sentence).
- Keep “Bold Call” concrete (specific point margin, player archetype, or scoring tier).
- Maintain consistent tone across all matchups.

File naming and publish steps:
- Save as markdown/previews/week[WEEK_NUMBER]-[YEAR].md
- Render at analysis/week[WEEK_NUMBER]-[YEAR].html (copy structure of analysis/week6-2025.html; update fetch path)
- Link from analysis/index.html under “Latest Analysis Posts” with title “Week [WEEK_NUMBER] Preview - [YEAR]”.

Example “Spice It Up” tone guides:
- “[TEAM A] drafts like a CPA and still brings receipts.”
- “[TEAM B] is a rooftop party; [TEAM A] is the HOA email.”
- “Bring sunscreen — regression’s about to shine.”
