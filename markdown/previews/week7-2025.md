## Matchups

### Matt vs Chaz
**Head-to-Head:** Matt leads 12–10 (22 games)  
**Avg Points:** Matt 95.85 — Chaz 87.23  
**Vibe Check:** This is one of the league's most frequent matchups with 22 historical meetings! Matt holds a slight edge in both wins and scoring average, but their 2025 seasons tell a different story - Chaz is 5-1 and tied for first place, while Matt is 2-4 and struggling. Chaz's 104.99 PPG vs Matt's 109.52 PPG shows Matt can score, but Chaz's consistency and record give him the edge.  
**Spice It Up:** Matt's spreadsheets have more formulas than a chemistry lab.  
**Bold Call:** Chaz's superior 2025 record overrides historical trends in another close one. **Edge: Chaz**

### Majors vs Ross
**Head-to-Head:** Tied 10–10 (20 games)  
**Avg Points:** Ross 95.12 — Majors 95.85  
**Vibe Check:** The brotherly rivalry is perfectly even historically with 20 meetings and identical records! Their Week 3 meeting was a one-sided affair with Ross dropping 147.52 points, but the 2025 season has been brutal for Majors (0-6, 84.22 PPG) while Ross (2-4, 105.45 PPG) has been inconsistent but capable of big games. Family dinner conversations might get interesting.  
**Spice It Up:** Ross is the older brother who always wins at everything.  
**Bold Call:** Ross's 2025 form and recent blowout win continue the family dominance. **Edge: Ross**

### Hunter vs Willis
**Head-to-Head:** Willis leads 8–7 (15 games)  
**Avg Points:** Willis 89.45 — Hunter 85.67  
**Vibe Check:** Willis holds a slight historical edge in this 15-game series, but their 2025 seasons are worlds apart. Willis is 5-1 with a league-leading 123.32 PPG, while Hunter is 1-5 with 97.19 PPG. Willis's Week 3 victory was closer than expected, but he's been absolutely dominant since then. This could be another statement game for Willis.  
**Spice It Up:** Willis is playing chess while Hunter is playing checkers.  
**Bold Call:** Willis's 2025 dominance continues with another 20+ point victory. **Edge: Willis**

### Trevor vs Jared
**Head-to-Head:** Jared leads 10–9 (19 games)  
**Avg Points:** Jared 95.23 — Trevor 85.67  
**Vibe Check:** Jared holds a slight edge in this 19-game series, and his 40.14-point victory in Week 3 was a complete domination. Their 2025 seasons are more evenly matched - Jared (3-3, 109.80 PPG) has been solid but inconsistent, while Trevor (3-3, 98.01 PPG) has been more reliable than expected. This could be closer than their first meeting.  
**Spice It Up:** Jared's lineup changes more than a chameleon's colors.  
**Bold Call:** Jared's historical edge and higher scoring ceiling wins out with another 15+ point victory. **Edge: Jared**

### Sawyer vs Sam
**Head-to-Head:** Sam leads 11–10 (21 games)  
**Avg Points:** Sawyer 95.23 — Sam 95.23  
**Vibe Check:** This is one of the league's most frequent matchups with 21 meetings, and it's incredibly close! Sam holds a slight edge in wins, but their scoring averages are identical. Sawyer's 16-point victory in Week 3 shows these teams are competitive, and their 2025 seasons are surprisingly close - Sawyer (4-2, 103.30 PPG) has the better record, but Sam (3-3, 108.55 PPG) has been scoring more. This could be a tight contest.  
**Spice It Up:** Sawyer is the spreadsheet; Sam is the gut feeling.  
**Bold Call:** Sawyer's better 2025 record and consistency wins out with another 8+ point victory. **Edge: Sawyer**

### Basil vs Ean
**Head-to-Head:** Ean leads 8–7 (15 games)  
**Avg Points:** Ean 90.45 — Basil 95.23  
**Vibe Check:** Ean holds a slight edge in this 15-game series, but Basil has the higher scoring average. Their 2025 seasons are nearly identical - both are 4-2 with similar scoring (Basil 108.46 PPG, Ean 106.36 PPG). Ean's 10.4-point victory in Week 3 was closer than the score suggests. This is truly the most evenly matched game of the week.  
**Spice It Up:** Ean's waiver wire moves are more unpredictable than a weather forecast.  
**Bold Call:** Another close one with Basil's slightly higher 2025 scoring average winning by 5+ points. **Edge: Basil**
