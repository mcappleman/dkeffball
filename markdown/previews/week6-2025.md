## Matchups

### Matt vs Trevor
- Head-to-Head: Matt leads 11-7 (18 games)
- Avg Points: Matt 93.68 — Trevor 92.71
- Vibe Check: This one’s always tight. Matt edges Trevor historically by a field goal per game. Trevor’s been hot-and-cold this year; if he falls behind early, Matt’s clock-control spreadsheet ball ends it quick.
- Spice It Up: Matt drafts like a CPA and still finds receipts. Trevor, bring sunscreen — you’re about to get burned by regression.
- Bold Call: First to 100 wins. Edge: Matt.

### Majors vs Chaz
- Head-to-Head: Majors leads 10-3 (13 games)
- Avg Points: Majors 105.91 — Chaz 87.93
- Vibe Check: Chaz walks into a personal house of horrors here. Majors doesn’t just win; he leans on Chaz like a power back in the fourth. Chaz needs elite WR play to break the curse.
- Spice It Up: Majors has a punch card at this matchup — two more wins and the coffee’s free. Chaz, consider witness protection if this starts 0-1.
- Bold Call: If Chaz’s WR1 doesn’t top 22, it’s over by Sunday afternoon. Edge: Majors.

### Hunter vs Sawyer
- Head-to-Head: Sawyer leads 12-7 (19 games)
- Avg Points: Hunter 92.91 — Sawyer 104.04
- Vibe Check: This has been Sawyer’s rivalry. Hunter’s path is a low-variance grind; Sawyer’s path is big plays and bigger waves. If Sawyer’s squad gets rolling, Hunter will be chasing all day.
- Spice It Up: Hunter brings a lunch pail; Sawyer brings a fireworks permit. Hope you packed earplugs, Hunter — it’s about to get loud.
- Bold Call: Highest combined points of the week. Edge: Sawyer.

### Willis vs Sam
- Head-to-Head: Sam leads 11-9 (20 games)
- Avg Points: Willis 89.82 — Sam 93.38
- Vibe Check: The quiet classic. Sam’s got the slight historical lean and the higher scoring baseline. Willis usually wins the rock fights; Sam wins the track meets. Game script will tell early.
- Spice It Up: Willis is bringing flip phones to a smartphone fight. Sam’s got the app for this one — and the updates.
- Bold Call: Decided by under 5 points. Edge: Sam (barely).

### Ross vs Ean
- Head-to-Head: Ross leads 11-6 (17 games)
- Avg Points: Ross 104.12 — Ean 92.74
- Vibe Check: Ross has history and fireworks. Ean needs efficiency and touchdowns in the red zone to keep this in range. If the ceiling games pop, Ross runs away.
- Spice It Up: Ross is a rooftop party; Ean is an HOA email. One of these is more fun on Sunday.
- Bold Call: Ross posts a top-3 score this week. Edge: Ross.

### Basil vs Jared
- Head-to-Head: Basil leads 15-4 (19 games)
- Avg Points: Basil 101.99 — Jared 82.63
- Vibe Check: This rivalry is a one-way street. Basil holds the deed, the title, and probably the HOA. Jared’s best path is chaos: turnovers, unexpected WR spike weeks, and praying for bye-week miracles.
- Spice It Up: Basil has frequent flyer miles on Jared Airlines. Boarding now: Zone Defense, Group Everyone.
- Bold Call: Basil wins by 20+. Edge: Basil.
